# CRUD-Operations

This is a basic project in which I am building a form, applying basic CRUD operations as a goal to learn the basics.
I added a simple name and email input and stored the data in an api, used mockapi, and displayed the data in a different page using react-router.
Added functionality to edit and delete the data.
Also applied the basics of how to store the data in the local storage to access it in different pages.
